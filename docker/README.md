Pamela/Docker
==========

- `latest` -> `debian:latest`

Using
-----

The images are built by [Docker hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/blowaxd693/pamela/).
Each Debian release corresponds to a tag.  To run an SSH daemon in a new Debian "wheezy"
container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 2222:22 -e SSH_KEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" blowa/pamela:latest
```

This requires a public key in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.

Two users exist in the container: `root` (superuser) and `docker` (a regular user
with passwordless `sudo`). SSH access using your key will be allowed for both
`root` and `docker` users.

To connect to this container as `root`:

```bash
$> ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
```

To connect to this container as regular user:

```bash
$> ssh -p 2222 blowa@localhost
$> ssh -p 2222 doom@localhost
```

Change `2222` to any local port number of your choice.


Enhancing
---------

Each Debian release corresponds to a Git branch, the branches differ only by
the `FROM` element in the `Dockerfile`.

To create the image `blowaxd693/pamela` e.g:

```bash
$> git checkout master
$> make build
```

Use `make rebuild` to pull the base image and rebuild without caching.


Testing
-------

Execute `make test` to create a container and fetch all environment variables
via SSH.

This requires an `.ssh/id_rsa.pub` file in your home, it will be
passed to the container via the environment variable `SSH_KEY` and installed.


The `Makefile` is configured to run the container with the limited `docker`
account, this user is allowed to run `sudo` without requiring a password.
The SSH daemon will be always run with root access.  The `debug-*` targets
can help troubleshooting any issues you might encounter.
